The chatbot era is over. The agentic era just became infrastructure.

Anthropics Model Context Protocol — now adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google through the Linux Foundation — is establishing the standard for how AI agents communicate across systems. Meanwhile, GPT-5.2 and Anthropic have traded positions: OpenAI leads on pure analytical intelligence, Anthropic dominates agentic workflows and real-environment execution. Two different architectures for two different categories of work.

This is not incremental improvement. It is a fundamental redesign of how AI operates inside organizations. The vocabulary of orchestrators and executors — models that know their role, stay in scope, and coordinate with each other — is becoming standard design language. Alibaba and ByteDance are building for this with Qwen3.5 and Doubao 2.0. Infosys just partnered with Anthropic specifically to deploy AI agents across telecom, financial services, and manufacturing.

For CTOs, the architectural decision in front of you has changed. The question is no longer which model to use. It is how to design multi-agent systems where specialized models operate within defined roles, share context through standardized protocols, and produce reliable outputs at enterprise scale.

The organizations that build this orchestration layer first will compound their advantage. Those still evaluating chatbot use cases are already a generation behind.

Has your technical leadership defined a clear position on orchestrator-executor architecture, or are you still evaluating AI at the individual model level?
