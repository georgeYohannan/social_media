The AI industry just collectively declared the chatbot era over. The agentic era has a date now, and it is this week.

Anthropic's Model Context Protocol is now adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google through the Linux Foundation. Infosys launched a dedicated Anthropic Centre of Excellence to deploy AI agents across telecom, financial services, and manufacturing. Alibaba released Qwen3.5 and ByteDance shipped Doubao 2.0 -- both explicitly built for autonomous agent workflows. Cursor scaled its agentic coding model 20x with Composer 1.5.

This is not incremental. The infrastructure layer for autonomous AI agents is being standardized across every major platform simultaneously. MCP becoming the shared protocol means agents built on one stack can communicate with tools on another. That is the interoperability moment that turns AI agents from demos into deployable enterprise systems.

For CTOs: your architecture decisions in the next six months will determine whether your organization can plug into this ecosystem or gets locked out of it. For CEOs: the companies moving fastest are not experimenting with agents. They are building dedicated centers of excellence and rewriting operational processes around them.

The design vocabulary of orchestrators and executors is becoming standard. The question is whether your team speaks it yet.

What operational process in your organization would you redesign first if you had reliable autonomous agents?
