Software development just crossed another threshold — and every CTO needs to recalculate their engineering capacity.

OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, its latest coding-specialized model. Days later, Cursor shipped Composer 1.5, which scales reinforcement learning 20x beyond its predecessor and actually exceeds the base models pretraining compute. Composer 1.5 uses thinking tokens to reason through codebases, dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity, and handles long contexts through self-summarization.

These are not productivity tools bolted onto existing workflows. They are architectural shifts in how software gets built. A model that reasons about a codebase — not just generates code snippets — changes the relationship between engineering teams and their output.

Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora confirmed what the data already shows: coding assistants are the most widely adopted AI tools in enterprise today. But adoption is still shallow. Most organizations are using AI for autocomplete-level tasks while these tools are now capable of full agentic development workflows.

The implication for CTOs is direct. Engineering team sizing, sprint planning, technical debt strategies, and build-vs-buy decisions all need to be reassessed against what a 20x improvement in AI-assisted development actually enables. The gap between organizations using AI for code completion and those using it for agentic software development will define competitive positioning over the next 18 months.

Have you benchmarked your engineering teams current AI-assisted output against what these new tools actually enable — and identified where the gap creates strategic risk?
