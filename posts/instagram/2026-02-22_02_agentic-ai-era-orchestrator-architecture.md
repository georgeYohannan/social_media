The chatbot era just ended. The agent era is now infrastructure.

Anthropics Model Context Protocol — the framework that lets AI agents talk to each other and to enterprise systems — has been adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. It is becoming the standard. Not a proposal. Not a beta. The standard.

At the same time, the competitive landscape has reorganized. OpenAIs GPT-5.2 leads on deep analytical reasoning. Anthropic leads on agentic workflows — AI that can actually execute complex tasks across real systems. They have traded positions, and both are building walls around their new territory.

Alibaba and ByteDance are building for this same shift. Infosys just partnered with Anthropic to deploy AI agents across telecom, financial services, and manufacturing.

The design language of AI is changing from prompt and response to orchestrator and executor. Multiple specialized models, each with a defined role, coordinating through shared protocols.

For business leaders, the decision is no longer which model to adopt. It is how to architect systems where agents work together reliably at scale.

GYanTech AI builds agentic architectures for organizations ready to move beyond chatbots. Link in bio.
