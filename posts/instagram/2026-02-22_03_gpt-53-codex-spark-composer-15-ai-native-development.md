AI just changed how software gets built. Again.

OpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark — a coding model built for real development environments. Cursor followed with Composer 1.5, which scales reinforcement learning 20x beyond its predecessor and actually exceeds the base models pretraining compute.

What makes Composer 1.5 different is how it works. It uses thinking tokens to reason through entire codebases — not just generate individual code snippets. It adjusts its reasoning depth based on how hard the task is. It summarizes long contexts to maintain coherence across complex projects.

This is not a better autocomplete. It is an AI system that can reason about software architecture.

Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora recently confirmed that coding assistants are the most widely adopted AI tools in business. But most teams are still using them at the surface level while the tools have moved far ahead.

For technical leaders, this creates both opportunity and risk. Teams that integrate agentic development workflows will ship faster and handle complexity that was previously impractical. Teams that treat AI coding as a nice-to-have will fall behind — measurably and quickly.
