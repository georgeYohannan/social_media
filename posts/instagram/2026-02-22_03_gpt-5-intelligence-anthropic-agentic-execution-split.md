One model for everything? That era just ended.

GPT-5.2 still leads in raw intelligence -- the sharpest reasoning on complex, ambiguous problems. But Anthropic now dominates agentic execution: multi-step workflows, tool chains, real-world software development. They raised $30 billion to cement that position.

OpenAI responded with GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark. The counterattack is real. But the landscape has fundamentally split.

IBM called it clearly: 2026 is the year of frontier versus efficient model classes. Smart beats big. Specialized beats general.

For business leaders, this means your AI architecture cannot depend on a single vendor. The winning pattern is orchestration -- routing reasoning tasks to one model and execution tasks to another. The companies that master that integration layer will hold the advantage.

The vocabulary of orchestrators and executors is becoming the standard design language. The question is whether your team is building for it.
