The chatbot era is officially over.

This week, every major AI lab made the same move. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol -- the communication standard for AI agents -- is now adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google through the Linux Foundation. One protocol. Every major platform.

Infosys launched a dedicated centre of excellence with Anthropic to deploy AI agents across telecom, finance, and manufacturing. Not a proof of concept. A permanent operational unit.

Alibaba and ByteDance both released new models explicitly built for agent workflows. Cursor shipped Composer 1.5, scaling its agentic coding capabilities 20x.

This is the week autonomous AI agents went from conference demos to shared infrastructure. The interoperability layer is here. The enterprise playbooks are being written now.

The organizations that architect for this shift in the next six months will define the next decade. The ones that wait will spend years catching up.

GYanTech AI builds agentic AI strategies for enterprises ready to move. Link in bio.
