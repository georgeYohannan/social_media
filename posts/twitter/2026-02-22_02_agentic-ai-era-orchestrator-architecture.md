TWEET 1
The chatbot era is officially over. Anthropic's Model Context Protocol is now adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. The agentic architecture standard just locked in.

GPT-5.2 leads on pure intelligence. Anthropic leads on agentic execution. The two labs traded positions — and both are consolidating. Single-model strategies are now obsolete.

Alibaba launched Qwen3.5. ByteDance released Doubao 2.0 to 200M users. Both positioned explicitly for the agent era. This is not a Western tech story — it is global infrastructure.

TWEET 4
Infosys partnered with Anthropic to deploy AI agents across telecom, finance, and manufacturing. Enterprise agentic deployment is no longer theoretical — it is underway.

TWEET 5
The new design vocabulary: orchestrators and executors. Models that know their role, stay in scope, and communicate through standardized protocols. This is how production AI works now.
