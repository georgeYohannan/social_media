TWEET 1
OpenAI and Anthropic traded positions this month. GPT-5.2 owns intelligence. Anthropic owns execution. Your AI vendor strategy needs to reflect the split ->

TWEET 2
GPT-5.2: still the benchmark for pure reasoning and ambiguous problem analysis. If you need the smartest answer to a hard question, it leads.

TWEET 3
Anthropic: now dominant in agentic workflows, complex tool chains, and real-environment software development. Execution, not intelligence, is their ground. $30B raised to hold it.

TWEET 4
OpenAI fired back with GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark on Feb 12. IBM called 2026 the year of frontier vs. efficient model classes. The one-model-fits-all era is done.

TWEET 5
The winning architecture: orchestrators pair frontier reasoning models with specialized execution agents. Each model stays in its lane. The integration layer is the moat.

TWEET 6
Is your AI stack still single-vendor? That is an architectural risk in 2026. Build for orchestration -> www.gyantechai.com @GYanTechAI
