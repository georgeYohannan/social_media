The shift everyone has been talking about just became real. The chatbot era is over — agentic AI is now infrastructure.

Anthropics Model Context Protocol, the framework that enables AI agents to communicate with each other and with enterprise systems, has been adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google through the Linux Foundation. That is not a trend. That is a standard being set.

The competitive map has redrawn itself too. OpenAIs GPT-5.2 leads on pure analytical intelligence — the hardest reasoning and analysis tasks. Anthropic now dominates agentic execution — complex tool chains, software development in live environments, multi-step workflows. Both labs have consolidated into their strengths.

This matters because the architecture of enterprise AI is fundamentally changing. Instead of one model doing everything, organizations need orchestration layers — specialized models that each handle a defined role and coordinate through standardized protocols. Alibaba, ByteDance, and Infosys are already building for this reality.

For executives and CTOs, the strategic question has evolved. It is no longer about choosing a model. It is about designing the system that connects multiple models into reliable, scalable workflows.
