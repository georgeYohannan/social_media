Four companies are spending $650 billion on AI this year. The stock market just responded by erasing $430 billion from their valuations.

Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have committed to the largest AI infrastructure buildout in history — data centers, chips, power generation — all to run AI at scale. But investors are no longer applauding the ambition. Apple has lost $256 billion in market cap since January. Nvidia dropped $89 billion. Alphabet shed $88 billion.

The signal is unmistakable. Capital markets have moved from rewarding AI promises to demanding AI proof. Earnings calls across industries are now dominated by AI risk discussion, even during a quarter of strong profit growth.

For business leaders, this shift has real operational consequences. Boards are tightening scrutiny on AI budgets. CFOs are asking harder questions about time-to-value. The organizations that will attract capital and talent are the ones connecting AI investment directly to revenue — not the ones running open-ended experiments.

This does not mean slowing down. It means building with precision. The opportunity is enormous, but only for those who can demonstrate that their AI spend translates into business performance.
